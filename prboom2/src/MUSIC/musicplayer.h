/*
Anything that implements all of these functions can play music in prboomplus.

render: If audio output isn't delivered by render (say, for midi out), then the
player won't be recordable with video capture.  In that case, still write 0s to
the buffer when render is called.

thread safety: Locks are handled in i_sound.c.  Don't worry about it.

Timing: If you're outputting to render, your timing should come solely from the
calls to render, and not some external timing source.  That's why things stay
synced.
