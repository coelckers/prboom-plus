PrBoom 2.6.2

PrBoom is a version of the classic 3D shoot'em'up game Doom, originally
written by id Software.

See the file AUTHORS in this distribution for a list of authors and
other contributors, and a history of the projects PrBoom is derived
from.

PrBoom is made available under the GNU General Public License. See the
file COPYING included in this distribution for details.

Please see the NEWS file included for changes since the previous version.

Game data - WADs
----------------

(This section is aimed at people not familiar with Doom and the
data files it uses.)

PrBoom is a game engine - it provides a program to play Doom levels, but
it doesn't include any levels itself. More importantly, you need all the
sounds, sprites, and other graphics that make up the Doom environment.
So to play PrBoom, you need one of the main Doom date files from id
Software - either doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from one
of the commercial Doom games, or the shareware doom1.wad. This file
is called the IWAD.

PrBoom also supports playing Doom add-on levels, called "PWADs", which
are small extra .wad files which just contain extra levels or other
resources. PWADs are ONLY ADD-ONS, you still need the original IWAD
that they are designed to work with. In practice, most PWADs on the
Internet require doom2.wad (although some work with doom.wad).

If you don't own any of the Doom games, get the shareware doom1.wad
from doom19s.zip on Doomworld's shareware download page. But note that you
will not be able to play most add-ons.

Windows Installation
--------------------

Just extract the zip to a directory of your choice and copy your IWAD
files into it. Now you can make shortcuts and add "-iwad filename.wad"
to them.

The SDL_mixer library used by PrBoom supports software MIDI music
synthesis. If you want to hear the Doom music, you need a set of
Timidity instrument patches. Do a web search for timidity patch sets,
there are plenty around.
These patch sets are a large download (>5megs).
SDL_mixer does not currently support hardware MIDI synthesis. But we
have added a hacked version of SDL_mixer with native midi support. If
you like to try it out, rename SDL_mixer_beta.dll to SDL_mixer.dll.
You should rename the original SDL_mixer.dll before. Tell us if it
works or not. Please note, that there might be bugs in the native midi
implementation.

Linux Installation
------------------

For UNIX, Linux, and other POSIX systems, you need the SDL libraries in
order to use PrBoom. If you haven't already done so, visit
http://prboom.sourceforge.net/linux.html and follow the instructions there
for your system, downloading the necessary libraries, and either
installing the binary RPM package or compiling PrBoom from source.

Once you've done that, you'll need to copy your IWAD file (see the section
above if you don't know what this is) to a directory where PrBoom can find
it. Make /usr/local/share/games/doom/, and copy your IWAD (all of your
IWADs, if you own more than one) to that directory.

Mac OS Installation
-------------------

Copy your IWAD (see above) into your home folder under
Library:Application Support:PrBoom (this folder will be created for you the
first time you run PrBoom).

First Use
---------

If it's the first time you've run PrBoom, you'll need to do some configuring
to get the controls and display right for you.

On a new installation, PrBoom runs at 640x480 resolution. If you have used
PrBoom before, you may have an old config file in your home directory which
specifies a lower resolution, such as Doom's normal 320x200.  You can use the
-width and -height parameters to select a higher resolution, e.g.:

prboom -width 640 -height 400

sets the resolution. This setting is remembered for future sessions. For
other parameters, see the included README.command-line.

You may also wish to customise the key bindings. PrBoom's default keybindings
are the same as the original Doom; unlike original Doom, you can change key
bindings in the game. In the in-game menus, go to Options, Settings, Key
Bindings.

On Mac OS X, you can't use the command line, but after running the program
once, you can edit YOURHOME:Library:Application Support:PrBoom:prboom.cfg to
change settings like your screen resolution.

Features
--------

   This is all the features PrBoom has compared to the original Doom game
   - it's intended to give you an idea of the enhancements, rather than
   burying you in details.

   See http://prboom.sourceforge.net/about.html for an HTML version of
   this list.

   This is shamelessly modelled on Boom's changes pages. By each
   change, there's the name of the port the feature comes from (so it's
   compatible with).

Other Tips
----------

On Linux, SDL tries to detect an appropriate video device automatically.
If you want to overrite the default, you can set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER
enviromental variable. At a bash prompt, this is as easy as running:

SDL_VIDEODRIVER=fbcon prboom
or
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=svga prboom

Details
-------

Details on these extra features are split into separate text files:

README.demos		provides a guide to PrBoom's demo support
README.compatibility	describes PrBoom's various compatibility
			options and modes
README.command-line	gives a command line reference for prboom,
			prboom-game-server, and the format of boom.cfg.
			On UNIX/Linux systems use the man pages instead.

Editing features are not covered in the docs with this package. We plan
to bundle the editing docs as a separate download. Watch our website
for news.
